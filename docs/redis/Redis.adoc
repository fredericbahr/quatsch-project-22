= Redis

We use Redis to store session data inside the `action-server`. 

== What is Redis?

Redis is an open-source in-memory data structure store, used as a database, cache and message broker. It supports data structures such as strings, hashes, lists, sets, sorted sets with range queries, bitmaps, hyperloglogs and geospatial indexes with radius queries.

== Usage

We use redis to store related session data, that enhances the functionality of the `action-server` in order to provide a better user experience. 

We for example store the latest `session-id` from rasa and the latest `next-action` in order to handle fallbacks and automatically continue the conversation after a fallback.

We also store IP Lookup data in order to provide the user with a better experience by providing custom recommendations based on the user's location.
