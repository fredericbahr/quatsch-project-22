= Install with Docker (Recommended)

== Setup

Qanary components cannot be run in local Docker containers if they are accessed via `localhost`.
The problem is that the Qanary pipeline carries localhost as an address in the Qanary message object, which does not exist in the Docker container.

[source,bash]

npm install dotenv
node -r dotenv/config -e 'console.log(`\n`+Object.entries(process.env).filter(([key]) => key.match(/^(SPRING|RASA|ACTION|FRONTEND)(.*)NAME$/)).map(([, value]) => `127.0.0.1 ${value}`).join(`\n`));' >> ./hosts
sudo sh -c 'cat ./hosts >> /etc/hosts'
----

This script adds all services used in this project to the `/etc/hosts` file.
With this change the Qanary pipeline can be reached at http://qanary-pipeline:40111 instead of localhost.
