= Conventions

We agreed on a small set of naming conventions for the project. These conventions are not set in stone, but we should try to follow them as much as possible.

== General Code Conventions

* Use `camelCase` for variable and function names.
* Use `PascalCase` for class names.
* Naming should follow the clean code principles and be meaningful

=== Types

* explicitly define types for all variables and functions

=== Documentation

* Use `JSDoc`/`TSDoc` for documentation of atleast all public functions, variables and classes.
* Avoid inline/single line comments for explaning code, extract the code into a function with a meaningful name instead.

== Folder Structure

* Apps should be placed in the `apps` folder.
* Packages should be placed in the `packages` folder.
* Use `kebab-case` for folder names.

=== Differentiation between Apps and Packages

* An app is a standalone project that can be run on its own and will be deployed
** Deployment is done by an Docker image
** All projects with a `Dockerfile` are considered apps
* A package is a library that is used by other apps or packages
** Packages are not deployed
** All projects without a `Dockerfile` are considered packages

== Package naming

* Try to stick to the following naming scheme if possible and applicable: `context[-type][-name]`
* General packages should not be overcomplicated, keep it simple: e.g.Â `configs`, `e2e`

=== Packages

* Use the folder name as the `name` property in the `package.json` file
* Package names are defined by the `name` property in the `package.json` file
* Currently we do not use any scope for our packages
