.. *0_was-any-instance-identified.sparql:* Calculate the number of annotated entities and checks if there is at least one corresponding annotation.
.. *1_was-the-expected-instance-recognized.sparql:* Validate if the pre-defined values for test-case-specific replacements/placeholders are available in the graph as annotation of type `AnnotationOfRepresentation`.
