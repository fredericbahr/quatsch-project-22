Specialized LUBW data needed in Qanary

== Training Data

Custom training data for this the Qanary NER component and the Rasa NLU can be generated. Lubw domain instances for stations, measurands, calculations and representations will be combined with a set of training questions.

To generate usable training/testing data one of the following commands can be used:

[width="100%",cols="30%,70%",options="header",]

|Command |Description
|`npm run generate:csv` |generates NER training and testing data as CSV files for immediate training on container build
|`npm run generate:json` |generates NER training and testing data as JSON files for retraining via `/retrain` route
|`npm run generate:yml` |generates measurand complete NLU training data as YML file for Rasa NLU intent detection
|`generate:yml-small` |generates limited measurand complete NLU training data as YML file for Rasa NLU intent detection (used for faster training)
|`generate:yml-measurand-max` |generates measurand maximum NLU training data as YML file for Rasa NLU intent detection
|`generate:yml-measurand-min` |generates measurand minimum NLU training data as YML file for Rasa NLU intent detection
|`generate:yml-measurand-threshold` |generates measurand threshold NLU training data as YML file for Rasa NLU intent detection
