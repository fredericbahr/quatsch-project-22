= Qanary LUBW Data
:toc:

Specialized LUBW data needed in Chatbot applications.

Interfaces for the LUBW data are provided, as well as the data itself and scripts to generate data for the Qanary NER component and the Rasa NLU.

== Data

The following data is provided:

- `calculations`: a list of all possible and supported calculations
- `calculationLabels`: a list of all possible and supported calculations with their corresponding labels
- `measurands`: a list of all possible and supported measurands
- `popularStations`: a list of all popular stations
- `popularIntents`: a list of all popular intents
- `representations`: a list of all possible and supported representations
- `stations`: a list of all possible and supported stations

== Training Data

Custom training data for the Qanary NER component and the Rasa NLU can be generated. Lubw domain instances for stations, measurands, calculations and representations will be combined with a set of training questions.

To generate usable training/testing data one of the following commands can be used:

|Command |Description
|`npm run generate:ner-csv` |generates NER training and testing data as CSV files for immediate training on container build
|`npm run generate:ner-json` |generates NER training and testing data as JSON files for retraining via `/retrain` route
|`npm run generate:nlu` |generates measurand complete NLU training data as YML file for Rasa NLU intent detection
|`generate:nlu-small` |generates limited measurand complete NLU training data as YML file for Rasa NLU intent detection (used for faster training)
|`generate:nlu-measurand-max` |generates measurand maximum NLU training data as YML file for Rasa NLU intent detection
|`generate:nlu-measurand-min` |generates measurand minimum NLU training data as YML file for Rasa NLU intent detection
|`generate:nlu-measurand-threshold` |generates measurand threshold NLU training data as YML file for Rasa NLU intent detection
