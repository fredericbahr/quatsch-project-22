= Qanary Component PM
:toc:

This is a Qanary component for checking via a regular expression if a given question contains specific lubw domain instances.
The component receives the question via the knowledge graph.
It also receives the domain knowledge via the knowledge graph, which get seeded when asking the question.

== Functionality

The component fetches every rdf triple of the a `<urn:domain>` class, maps it to an internal representation and checks if the question contains an domain isntance.
If so, it adds the domain instance as an annotation to the knowledge graph.

Note that all matches are added to the knowledge graph.
This means that if the question contains multiple domain instances, all of them will be added to the knowledge graph.

Additionally the component logs found domain instances to the console.

No error handling is implemented as this component simply does not add annotations to the knowledge graph if errors occur.
