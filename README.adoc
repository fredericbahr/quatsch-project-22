== Project structure

The project is structured as follows:

* `apps/action-server` contains the code for the custom action server that is used by the chatbot to execute actions.
* `apps/frontend` contains the frontend code for serving an UI to interact with the chatbot.
* `apps/rasa` contains the code for the chatbot based on the rasa framework (actions, nlu, stories, â€¦).

The dependencies of the apps are located in the `packages` directory as in other multi-package repositories.
